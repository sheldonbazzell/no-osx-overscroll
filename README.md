# NoOSXOverscroll

## Prevent overscroll browser back navigation on a Mac.

### Why
---
A large portion of what I build at work relies on horizontally scrolling. Browser navigation via Mac's trackpad can yield a frustrating UX, so I sought ways to solve it. I didn't find an npm package for it so I decided to implement one and publish it.

### Features
---
This currently only supports browser back navigation.
